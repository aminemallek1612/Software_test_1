## Building the iOS App

A minimal iOS implementation is provided in the `ios_p2p_cash` directory. Open the folder in Xcode and build/run the `P2PCashAppiOSApp` target to launch the SwiftUI interface that performs the same basic operations as the Python example.

Unit tests for the Swift code can be found under `ios_p2p_cashTests` and can be executed with Xcode's testing features.
